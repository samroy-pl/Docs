## Planet Live Q&A Session

**3:40**

How can Planet data be turned into LULC for something like the Rohingya crisis so it can be used for numerical simulations to understand the hydrologic impacts of the camps?

**6:00**

Will land surface reflectance data (Planet and RapidEye) be available prior to 2018? And if not, how do you recommend atmospheric corrections of your legacy data? Thanks!

**7:20**

* We were granted access to Planet Labs Imagery for our Capstone Project. Are we able to present our findings in an open / public forum?
* We are trying to identify vessels that are fishing illegally, but are finding limited satellite imagery in deep sea. Is there a good place / time with coverage? https://www.planet.com/markets/education-and-research/

**10:10**

I am interested in an issue raised recently by Andrew (Zolli). In a press article - https://www.devex.com/news/taking-a-space-age-approach-to-food-security-92223 - he is quoted as follows: So although we’re in a “revolutionary period” where we’ve got all the satellite imagery we need to solve the problem, that alone cannot give all the answers, said Zolli: “What we don’t have, and where the bottleneck is, is really good, high-quality, gold-standard labelled ground data.” My question is how does Planet plan to address this? Thanks.

**12:20**

Is there enough demand to offer a reflectance product for RapidEye imagery, similar to that of PlanetScope? If so are there any technical challenges in introducing this?

**13:50**

How can you access SR data?

**14:30**

Reason for response 401 for a clip request. Error appearing in a loop over. A series of images. https://developers.planet.com/

**16:20**

Can you please give detailed information about the Education and Research Program, in terms of data usage, users, etc
* Tell me more about the Investigator license. 
* I cannot make the session, but would like to hear the recorded version...how do I do that? Thanks!

**18:45**

Is it possible to discuss collaborations with Planet, Human Rights Watch, and other humanitarian organizations for LULC projects related to Rohingya? https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/23/burma-scores-rohingya-villages-bulldozed www.planet.com/disasterdata

**21:45**

Would it be possible to have a tutorial for researchers who are not familiar with the Planet Earth API (or any API for that matter)?

**23:35**

Is anyone else working on forestry, forest inventory or invasive (tree) species? I would just like confer with anyone else working on similar applications…
As your data becomes more valuable and prevelent, I suspect active denial and deception will match. Can you discuss privacy and data integrity at Planet?

**27:00**

Interaction on Google Earth Engine
Is there a plan to allow academic users access to Planet imagery directly via Google Earth Engine without the need to download to a local machine and upload into GEE ?

**29:00**

How to use an ESRI shapefile as an AOI.

**33:35**

* When will the Raster Toolkit be released and will Investigator Accounts have dependable, long-term access? Will surface reflectance "analytic-sr" products be back-processed for old Planetscope imagery (pre-2018)? 
* When can we expect the new api release (the Early Access program) that allows simpler activation and download of batches of imagery and direct download to Amazon S3? 
* I've seen quite a few images that have quality issues (striping) that are not flagged in the udm mask, is Planet aware of and working on flagging these images?
* What are some alternative ways to filter to remove these images and does Planet have any cookbooks or guidelines for doing so? All of these questions are crucial to a current grant funded project I'm a part of!

Does planet collect field data related to vegetation? and is that available in some way?
 
**38:25**

TOA BOA
Is it possible to convert planet images to reflectance? https://developers.planet.com/tutorials/convert-planetscope-imagery-from-radiance-to-reflectance/

**39:55**

What are reliable ways to use time series data from Planet Scope satellites - causes and possible solutions for day-day variation in reflectance? How accurate is the atmospheric correction of the surface reflectance products, and can the parameters be accessed through an API? How can I find out my remaining quota when downloads have been performed through API?

**46:35**

I’m trying to set up a project to investigate the possibility of using Planet data to monitor road traffic volume in London. I have a project proposal that I’ve submitted to my department to request funding for a PhD student to work on the idea. In our university, especially in the engineering departments, it is a big help for us in securing funding for PhD projects if we can get a letter of support from industry. Would Planet be able/willing to help in providing such support? What would be the best way to go about this?

**50:05**

* What sort of data will be available from Planet for the Stanford Big Earth Hackathon?
* Will surface reflectance data be available?
* Are there any specific challenges that Planet would suggest teams work on? Data access and manipulation; project idea advice!

**51:20**

I'm interested in the work done to correct for the atmospheric column to get the surface reflectance from the radiance. Thanks.

How to detect clouds in images?

**53:10**

Have all the SR images been put up in the catalog?

**53:50**

Who is the Planet point person for matching up PS datasets to tag on the ground status?

**54:30**

Is there a technical document for SR algorithm? https://assets.planet.com/marketing/PDF/Planet_Surface_Reflectance_Technical_White_Paper.pdf
